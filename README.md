# Swarming Playground

## Overview

Sample application to play around with [Swarming](https://aka.dataminer.services/swarming).

## Key Features

* Ad hoc Swarming.
* Recover from critical agent failures.
* Load balancing.
* Swarming everything away from an agent to prepare for offline maintenance.

## Use cases

### Move elements to a new host in the DMS

### Swarm all elements away from an agent

### Add a new agent to the DMS and rebalance the cluster

### Recover elements from a failing agent

## Prerequisites

To deploy this integration from the Catalog, youâ€™ll need:

* DataMiner version 10.5.1 or higher.
* A DataMiner System connected to dataminer.services.

To actually use this integration you will need to [enable swarming](https://aka.dataminer.services/enable-swarming) which comes with its own prerequisites.
